                <h2>2025 Ducati Panigale V4 S First Ride Review <img  src="/images/crvenimotor.png" alt="ducatiSymbol"></h2>
                <p>
                    I am sore. My hands are slightly blistered, my upper arms are tender, and my lower back feels strained. It feels like I tried an extreme sport for the first time, or got in a fight, but it wasn’t that. I used a motorcycle to do this to myself. I spent a day at a racetrack with the new Ducati Panigale V4 S.
                    I know what you’re thinking and no, I didn’t crash the thing. It’s just hard to ride a powerful, modern showroom superbike as fast as you can. It’s a little ironic that one of Ducati’s main missions with the updated version of its flagship sport bike was to make it easier to ride. But I think it worked, and that’s part of why I feel like I fell down a long set of stairs. Let me explain.
                    This new version of the Panigale V4 carries the same name the model has used since 2018, but the 2025 update represents the first major overhaul of the bike in six years. The most significant change for this seventh generation of Ducati superbike is arguably the most basic sections of its chassis, which have been made a lot less rigid.
                    First, the swingarm, which made headlines by abandoning the single-sided design that Panigales up to this point have always had. More interesting than the double-sided aesthetic is the fact that it sees a reduction in lateral stiffness, to the tune of 37%.
                    The basic casting of the new swingarm is heavier than the old single-sided piece, but interestingly the new rear-suspension unit is about six pounds lighter. That’s because the old one, sexy as it was, needed a huge axle with massive bearings, plus some oddities like the eccentric chain-adjustment system, that ultimately ended up being heavier as an assembly.

                <h2>2025 BMW M5 <img  src="/images/png-transparent-car-transport-car-outline-angle-car-transport-thumbnail-removebg-preview.png" alt="BMWmsymbol"></h2>
                <p>The BMW M5 formula has stayed consistent over its many generations: it's the hottest version of the 5-series sedan, packing extra firepower and an upgraded chassis plus a meaner-looking body meant to communicate its performance potential. That rings true once again for the new 2025 M5, but with a surprising twist: the M5 is now exclusively available as a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) with a V-8 engine and an electric motor. The new gas-electric setup may be controversial to hardcore M5 aficionados, but the numbers speak for themselves: 717 horsepower and a claimed top speed of up to 190 mph, plus an estimated electric driving range of 25 miles on a full charge. Otherwise, the M5 remains focused on its sports-sedan mission thanks to all manner of performance-enhancing features, including adaptive dampers, available carbon-ceramic brakes, and a wide range of drive modes that take this four-door from mild to wild at the press of a button.
                    The new M5 is offered in a single trim level, but there are several big-ticket options and packages available. Carbon-ceramic brakes are $8500 extra, and the $900 M Drive Professional package adds additional drive modes. BMW will also offer a $2500 M Driver's package that increases the claimed top speed from 155 mph to 190 mph. The $1850 Executive package adds desirable equipment including ventilated front seats, rear-seat sunshades, a park-assist system, and heated rear seats.
                    The 2025 BMW M5's new plug-in-hybrid powertrain combines a twin-turbo 4.4-liter V-8 engine with an electric motor and an eight-speed automatic transmission. Total output sits at 717 horsepower—a roughly 100-hp jump over the last M5's unassisted V-8—and all-wheel drive remains standard. BMW will offer all manner of drive modes that adjust how the car uses its various propulsion sources, including a setting for the all-wheel-drive system that enables a rear-wheel-drive-biased drift mode. Adaptive dampers, rear-wheel steering, and huge brakes are standard. During our initial test drive of the M5 in Europe, we found that it offers huge power and capable handling in its sportier drive modes while still maintaining good ride quality and a quiet, luxurious demeanor in Comfort mode. The wide range of vehicle settings and adjustments available can be overwhelming, but once you're over the learning curve you should be able to dial in a mode that suits your liking. Our main complaint was the steering feel, which was too light and vague for our tastes.

                <h2>2025 Mercedes-Benz S-Class <img  src="/images/png-transparent-car-transport-car-outline-angle-car-transport-thumbnail-removebg-preview.png" alt="mercedesSymbol"></h2>
                <p>Long the choice for buyers seeking solid, unaffable deportment and a distinguished presence, the Mercedes-Benz S-class has become synonymous with power and wealth. Its six-figure starting price certainly plays a part, but it wouldn't have stayed on top for so long without the class-leading ride and comfort, upscale furnishings, and smooth and muscular powertrains that define it. The latter comes in the form of either a 429-hp turbocharged straight-six, a 496-hp twin-turbo V-8, or a plug-in hybrid that pairs the turbo six with an electric motor. The ride and handling benefit from a standard air-spring suspension, and heated and ventilated massaging front seats coddle the occupants. Well-equipped as standard, there's also a long list of optional hides, woods, and colors to personalize the S-class to your taste. If there is an area of contention, it's the sheer number of screens and their almost overwhelming amount of controls and features. Still, while many rivals including the Audi A8, BMW 7-series, and Genesis G90 have made inroads onto the big Benz's turf, for now at least, it remains the king of full-size luxury sedans.
                    Mercedes offers the S-class sedan with either a 429-hp turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six-cylinder engine in the S500 or a 496-hp twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 in the S580. Both powertrains are supplemented by a 48-volt hybrid system and pair with a nine-speed automatic transmission and 4Matic all-wheel drive. The S580e plug-in hybrid uses an inline-six and an electric motor to pump out 510 horsepower; all-wheel drive is standard here as well. We've luxuriated in the S-class sedan and put our test equipment on every model, all of which have delivered impressive acceleration. While every S-class rides on an air suspension, the optional E-Active Body Control has a "curve" function that subtly leans the car into corners. The S-class can also be equipped with an all-wheel-steering system that makes the big-bodied Merc surprisingly easy to maneuver in tight spaces.
                    Inside, the S-class prioritizes screens. Lots of them. The sedan is available with up to five, including a giant center touchscreen and a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster. The latter works in concert with other technology to create a three-dimensional effect, but—thankfully—it can be turned off if you'd prefer the screens to have a conventional appearance. There's also an enhanced head-up display that will show navigation directions in augmented reality. Arrows move and turn in real-time to supposedly better assist the driver. The build quality and cabin materials live up to Mercedes' upscale standards, and the sedan provides limousine-like accommodations for all passengers, specifically those riding in the back. The new model's rear-seat area offers slightly increased headroom and legroom, and it can also be equipped with power-adjustable reclining seats that have massage functions and extensive heating elements. Along with being physically coddled, those in the back should be mentally entertained by the optional rear-seat entertainment system that adds two 11.6-inch screens on the front seatbacks as well as the interactive LED interior lighting.
